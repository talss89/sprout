	<Card title="No more 'Can I get a DB dump?'">
		Store your uploads and database in a secure, central location and easily let your team get up and running with the correct version of content **with a one-liner - `sprout seed`**.
	</Card>

	<Card title="Unobtrusive">
		Sprout lets you commit a small `sprout.yaml` file as part of your WordPress project. It identifies the **exact version of database and wp-uploads content** required in order to seed a new environment.
	</Card>

	<Card title="Store anywhere">
		You can store your database and content in a Sprout repo - this can be a local path, SFTP, S3 bucket, or any number of supported backends via OpenDAL or rclone. **Have complete control over your data.**
	</Card>

	<Card title="Safe and efficient">
		Your data is **encrypted and deduplicated**, and stored in the proven and trusted Restic format. So much more efficient than chucking ZIPs around.
	</Card>

	<Card title="Built for speed">
		**Sprout is FAST**. Written in Rust, and provided as a single static binary, it will run anywhere.
	</Card>

	<Card title="Oops factor reduction">
		Sprout will **locally stash your current database and wp-uploads during destructive operations** - a nice safety net to have!
	</Card>
