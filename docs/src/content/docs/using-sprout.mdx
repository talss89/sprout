description: How to use Sprout, and what it's for
---

**Sprout solves the problem of sharing WordPress content and databases between developers.** 

With Sprout, you can take **snapshots** of your **project**'s WordPress content and database, upload them to a  **repository**, and let your team easily **seed** a new environment from your **snapshot**.

Getting the most out of Sprout is simple, but first, let's look at how it works...

## What is a Snapshot?

A snapshot is a copy of your WordPress uploads content and database at any point in time. With Sprout, we can easily create new snapshots, store them in a **repository**, and then **seed** a new environment using a stored snapshot.

Snapshots are deduplicated, so creating a new one only stores the changes since your last snapshot - nice and efficient. They're also encrypted too. 

## What is a Repository?

A Sprout repository, or "*repo*", is the location where Sprout will store your content for your WordPress projects. It can be a simple local folder (for testing purposes), or hosted elsewhere.

You can store multiple **projects** in a single repo.

Sprout keeps a list of "*repository definitions*" on your local machine, which tell Sprout exactly how to connect to a repo. You can share these definitions with others in your team to allow them to connect too.

Sprout can connect to a huge number of repo storage backends, such as S3, OneDrive, SFTP, Dropbox, Google Drive, WebDAV and more!

## What is a Project?

A project is a WordPress installation containing a `sprout.yaml` file.

The `sprout.yaml` file describes exactly which version of database uploads content to use when **seeding** a new environment.

You should always commit your `sprout.yaml` file to version control.

## What is Seeding?

Seeding is the process of restoring your WordPress uploads and database from a **snapshot**. 

If you've cloned a **project** with a `sprout.yaml` file, and you have the **repository** set up, all you need to do is run `sprout seed`.
