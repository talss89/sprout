import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Sprout is available as a small, single binary on both **Mac** and **Linux**. Installation commands are below, or you can [download a release from GitHub](https://github.com/talss89/sprout/releases), and add it to your `PATH` manually.

*Sprout should be installed on the same machine that is hosting WordPress.*
