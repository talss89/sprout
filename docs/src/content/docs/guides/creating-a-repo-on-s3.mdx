title: Creating a repo on S3
description: Creating an S3 backed Sprout repo
---

*To really make Sprout work for your team, you'll probably want to store your content somewhere central. Amazon S3 (or other S3 compatible services) can be a great choice. Let's set up a new repo on S3!*

:::tip[You will need...]
- An S3, or S3 compatible bucket with read / write access
- Your access key and secret for the bucket
:::

## 1. Create the repo definition

Let's create a new repo definition. Let's call it something unique, like `my-s3-repo`...

```bash
sprout repo new my-s3-repo
```

Sprout will now fire up an editor, allowing you to modify the repo definition. As we're going to use S3, we need to use `opendal:s3` as our `repository`, and set some other options:

```diff lang="yaml" title="~/.sprout/repos/my-s3-repo.yaml" {2, 5-10}
repo_key: ''
repository: opendal:s3
repo-hot: null
-options: {}
+options:
+  access_key_id: <YOUR S3 ACCESS KEY>
+  endpoint: <YOUR S3 ENDPOINT>
+  region: <YOUR S3 REGION>
+  secret_access_key: <YOUR S3 SECRET>
+  bucket: <YOUR S3 BUCKET NAME>
options-hot: {}
options-cold: {}
```

:::tip
For a list of `options` for S3, see the [OpenDAL documentation page for the S3 service](https://opendal.apache.org/docs/services/s3#configuration).
:::

Make sure to save and exit the editor when you're done.

## 2. Initialise the repo

Now initialise the repo by running:

```bash
sprout repo init my-s3-repo
```

Let Sprout create and set a repo key for you. This is your encryption key for your repo, **not your S3 access key**. They should be unique.

If all goes well, you should see success.

## 3. Test!

Now everything is set up, let's push a snapshot.

Switch to an existing Sprout project (or initialise a new one with `sprout init`), then edit the `sprout.yaml` file to point to our new repo definition.

**It's also a good idea to clear the `snapshot` ID field too when changing repo:**

```diff lang="yaml" title="~/projects/my-existing-project/sprout.yaml" {3,5}
name: my-existing-project
branch: main
snapshot: ''
uploads_path: public/content/uploads
repo: my-s3-repo
```

Now we are ready to snapshot. Let's run:

```bash
sprout snap
```

The initial snapshot should complete - it may take a little while. There is no parent present, so the first snapshot will need to upload all of your content. Subsequent snapshots will be faster.

Let's check and see if we can see the snapshot in our repo. List the snapshots by running:

```bash
sprout ls
```

You should see your new snapshot! That's all there is to it.

## 4. Sharing your repo definition

When using a remote storage backend for a repo, we often want to share our repo definitions with the rest of our team. All your repo definitions exist at `~/.sprout/repos`.

It's not a good idea to send our S3 access keys and secrets around as part of the definition, so you should replace any sensitive keys with an environment variable. For example:

```yaml title="~/.sprout/repos/linode.yaml" {5,8}
repo_key: Kheq43pnuJGdidIY0uItHinKIIl34kedImyIs3cr3tsL5l4hCBketjqcjN
repository: opendal:s3
repo-hot: null
options:
  access_key_id: ${S3_ACCESS_KEY}
  endpoint: https://s3.amazonaws.com
  region: eu-west-1
  secret_access_key: ${S3_SECRET}
  bucket: sprout-test
options-hot: {}
options-cold: {}
```
