title: Creating a repo on S3
description: Creating an S3 backed Sprout repo
---

*To really make Sprout work for your team, you'll probably want to store your content somewhere central. Amazon S3 (or other S3 compatible services) can be a great choice. Let's set up a new repo on S3!*

## 0. Prerequisites

You'll need a few things:

- An S3, or S3 compatible bucket with read / write access
- Your access key and secret for the bucket

## 1. Create the repo definition

Let's create a new repo definition. We will need to label it. 

```
sprout repo init my-teams-s3-repo
```

## 2. Set up the S3 connection

## 3. Initialise the repo

## 4. Test!

## 5. Sharing your repo definition
